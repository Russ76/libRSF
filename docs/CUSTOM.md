[How to use the our cost functions?](CUSTOM_FACTORS.md)

[How to use our robust error models?](CUSTOM_ERROR_MODELS.md)

[How to use our data structures?](CUSTOM_IN_OUT.md)

We provide a minimal example CMakeList.txt to include the libRSF into your CMake project:

```CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(your_project)
